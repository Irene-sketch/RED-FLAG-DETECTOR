### Project Description
The "Red Flag Detector" is designed to help users identify and recognize problematic behaviours, patterns, or warning signs across various life contexts such as relationships, business, mental health, and social situations. By utilizing a combination of user inputs and data aggregation, this empowers individuals to make informed decisions by flagging potential issues before they escalate into more significant problems

### The Problem statement
Today‚Äôs fast-paced world, individuals often encounter complex relationships, communication challenges, and uncertain decisions in their personal and professional lives. Identifying unhealthy behaviors, potential risks, or harmful patterns‚Äîcommonly referred to as "red flags"‚Äîcan be difficult. Many people struggle to recognize subtle signs of toxicity in relationships or communication, leading to prolonged emotional, mental, and even physical distress.There is a need for a tool that helps users spot these red flags early, whether in interpersonal relationships, professional environments, or other decision-making processes.

### The Solution
We Create a Red Flag Detector App that uses quizzes, behavioral analysis, AI-driven suggestions, and educational resources to help users identify potential red flags in various aspects of life, including personal relationships, professional settings, and other decision-making processes.
- User Categories:
Relationship Red Flags: Detect warning signs in personal relationships such as emotional manipulation, dishonesty, disrespect, or toxic behavior.
Professional Red Flags: Help users identify toxic workplace culture, unethical behavior, poor management, or potential job-related risks.
Financial Red Flags: Assist users in recognizing signs of financial fraud, risky investments, or unethical business practices.
Health and Wellness Red Flags: Educate users on early symptoms of potential health issues or unhealthy lifestyle habits.
Self-Reflection Red Flags: Allow users to assess their own behaviors for negative patterns like procrastination, poor decision-making, or emotional instability.
-Interactive Quizzes:
Each user category will feature customized quizzes that users can take to assess whether they are facing any red flags in their current situation.
Example questions could assess communication styles, behaviors observed in others, financial choices, or emotional well-being.
After completing a quiz, users will receive a score indicating the presence of potential red flags and an explanation of the results.

This HTML code creates a simple web page for a "Red Flag Detector" with a welcoming interface and two action buttons. Here's a brief breakdown of what happens in the code:
HTML Structure:
The document uses a basic HTML structure with <!DOCTYPE html> and <html lang="en">, specifying the document type and language.
The <head> section includes metadata such as character encoding (UTF-8), viewport settings for responsive design, and the title of the webpage (Red Flag Detector).
A link to an external CSS file (style.css) is added using Flask's url_for function to apply additional styling.
Page Layout and Content:
The <body> has an inline style to set the background color to a soft red shade (rgb(226, 178, 178)).
Inside the <body>, there's a <div class="container"> that holds the main content:
A large, centered <h1> element with the text "Welcome to Red Flag Detector" in red color.
A paragraph (<p>) briefly explaining the purpose of the page, encouraging users to analyze situations for red flags.
A div class .options holds two buttons that link to other parts of the website:
The first button labeled "Go to Detector" takes the user to the /detector page when clicked.
The second button labeled "Take a Quiz" redirects the user to the /categories page for quizzes.
Footer:
At the bottom, a <footer> section includes a copyright message (¬© 2025 ByteSquad. All Rights Reserved.).
Navigation:
The buttons use the onclick attribute to trigger navigation to different URLs when clicked (/detector and /categories).
In summary, this code builds a simple homepage for the Red Flag Detector, offering users two options to either access the detector tool or take a quiz, with basic styling and layout.
